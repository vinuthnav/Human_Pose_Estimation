**Human Posture Estimation using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This project leverages MediaPipe's Pose solution and OpenCV to estimate human posture in real-time via webcam input. The system provides keypoint detection for 33 body landmarks, making it suitable for various applications like fitness tracking, ergonomic monitoring, and gesture recognition.

Features
Real-time human posture detection using webcam input.
Identification and visualization of 33 body landmarks.
Highly customizable detection and tracking confidence thresholds.
Lightweight and efficient solution leveraging MediaPipe.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for the project.
MediaPipe: Used for pose estimation and landmark detection.
OpenCV: Used for video capture and image processing.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/vinuthnav/Human_Pose_Estimation.git
cd human-posture-estimation
2. Set Up a Python Environment
(Optional but recommended)

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Verify Installation
Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed:

bash
Copy
python --version
Ensure OpenCV and MediaPipe are installed:

bash
Copy
python -c "import cv2, mediapipe; print('Setup complete!')"
Usage
Run the Posture Estimation Script
bash
Copy
python posture_estimation.py
Instructions:
Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning properly.
A window displaying the webcam feed with pose landmarks will open.
Press 'q' to exit the application.

OpenCV
MediaPipe
A functional webcam or external camera
To install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Customization
You can adjust the following parameters in the code to fine-tune the performance:

min_detection_confidence: Confidence for detecting a person.
min_tracking_confidence: Confidence for tracking landmarks.
Frame size: Resize for faster processing.
Output
The real-time feed displays:

Detected body landmarks.
Pose connections drawn using MediaPipe Drawing Utilities.
Applications
Fitness Tracking: Analyze posture during workouts.
Ergonomic Monitoring: Maintain proper posture while working.
Gesture Recognition: Detect body poses for interactive applications.
Sports Analytics: Enhance sports performance with pose estimation.
Known Issues
Requires sufficient lighting for accurate detection.
Low tracking accuracy for extremely fast movements.
May not perform efficiently on older hardware.
Future Enhancements
Integrate a GUI for user interaction.
Save detected poses for post-processing and analysis.
Incorporate custom actions or pose alerts.
